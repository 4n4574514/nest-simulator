> NEST is a simulator for spiking neural networks. Development is
  coordinated by the [NEST Iniative](http://nest-initiative.org). For
  details about how to use NEST for your own modeling studies, see
  [http://nest-simulator.org](http://nest-simulator.org).

<hr>

We use a private repository for internal development, while all
general development happens in the public repository. The development
workflow is based on pull requests combined with continuous
integration and code review, before the pull.

» [Code review guidelines](code_review_guidelines)  
» [Continuous integration](continuous integration)  

If you intend to develop your own models for NEST and contribute them
to the official NEST repository, your code should adhere to some
minimal coding and naming conventions. The corresponding guidelines
can be found here:

» [Coding Guidelines for C++](coding_guidelines_c++)  
» [Coding Guidelines for SLI](coding_guidelines_sli)  

» [Naming convention for neuron models](neuron_model_naming)  
» [Naming convention for synapse models](synapse_model_naming)  
» [Naming convention for variables and parameters](variables_parameters_naming)
