    "- Reversal potentials are assumed constant.\n",
    "- Synaptic currents $I_{\\text{syn}}$ and intrinsic currents $I_{\\text{int}}$ are discussed below. In contrast to the paper, they are shown with positive sign here (just change in notation).\n",
    "- The last term is a re-polarizing current only active during the refractory period, see below. Note that it has a different (faster) time constant than the other currents. It might have been more natural to use the same time constant for all currents and instead adjust $g_{\\text{spike}}$. We follow the original approach here."
