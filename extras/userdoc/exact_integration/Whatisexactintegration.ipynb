    "# What you always wanted to know about \"exact integration\"! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The simple integrate-and fire model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simple integrate-and-fire model the voltage $V$ is given as a solution of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C\\frac{dV}{dt}=I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the derivate of the law of capacitance $Q=CV$. When an input current is applied, the membrane voltage increases with time until it reaches a constant threshold $V_{\\text{th}}$, at which point a delta function spike occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A shortcoming of the simple integrate-and-fire model is that it implements no time-dependent memory. If the model receives a below-threshold signal at some time, it will retain that voltage boost until it fires again. This characteristic is not in line with observed neuronal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The leaky integrate-and fire model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the leaky integrate-and-fire model, the memory problem is solved by adding a \"leak\" term $\\frac{-1}{R}V$ ($R$ is the resistance and $\\tau=RC$) to the membrane potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)   $\\frac{dV}{dt}=\\frac{-1}{\\tau}V+\\frac{1}{C}I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects the diffusion of ions that occurs through the membrane when some equilibrium is not reached in the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving a  homogeneous linear differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve (1) we start by looking at a simpler differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{df}{dt}=af$, where $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ and $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the solution is given by $f(t)=e^{at}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation\n",
    "When you add another function $g$ to the right hand side of our linear differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{df}{dt}=af+g$ (this is now a non-homogeneous differential equation)\n",
    "\n",
    "things (can) become more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving it with variation of contants\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of differential equation is usually solved with \"variation of constants\" which gives us the following solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(t)=e^{ct}\\int_{0}^t g(s)e^{-cs}ds$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obviously not a particularly handy solution since calculating the integral in every step is very costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving it with exact integration\n",
    "\n",
    "With exact integration these costly computations can be avoided. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Restrictions to $g$\n",
    "But only for certain functions $g$! I.e. if $g$ satisfies (is a solution of):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\right)^n g= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\right)^{i-1} g$ \n",
    "\n",
    "for some $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ and a sequence $(a_i)_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\subset \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example this would be the case for $g=\\frac{e}{\\tau_{syn}}t e^{-t/\\tau_{\\text{syn}}}$ (an alpha funciton), where $\\tau_{\\text{syn}}$ is the rise time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reformulating the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-homogeneous differential equation is reformulated as a multidimensional homogeneous linear differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{d}{dt}y=Ay$ where \n",
    "\n",
    "$A=\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "a_{n}&a_{n-1}&\\cdots&\\cdots&a_1&0\\\\\n",
    "1&0&\\cdots&0&0&0\\\\\n",
    "0&\\ddots&\\ddots&\\vdots&\\vdots&\\vdots\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots&\\ddots&\\ddots&0&0&0\\\\\n",
    "0&0&\\ddots&1&0&0\\\\\n",
    "0&0&\\cdots&0&\\frac{1}{C}&-\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "by choosing $y_1,...,y_n$ canonically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "y_1&=\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\right)^{n-1}g\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots&=\\vdots\\\\\n",
    "y_{n-1}&=\\frac{d}{dt}g\\\\\n",
    "y_{n}&=g\\\\\n",
    "y_{n+1}&=f.\n",
    "\\end{align*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes ist very easy to determine the solution as\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(t)= e^{At}y_0$ and \n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{t+h}=y(t+h)=e^{A(t+h)}\\cdot y_0=e^{Ah}\\cdot e^{At}\\cdot y_0=e^{Ah}\\cdot y_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that once we have calculated $A$, propagation consists of multiplications only.\n",
