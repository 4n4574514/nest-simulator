Name: testsuite::ticket-541 - Regression test for aeif_cond_alpha reset

Synopsis:

(ticket-541) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test is based on an original Python demonstrator by Abigail Morrison 
(see #541). 
Per r10018, no-one can reproduce the error and the test is very slow. 
Therefore, this test resides in manualtests.
