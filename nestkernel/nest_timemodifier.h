/*
TimeModifier is an interface class which defines the networks's
ability to modify the representation of time. It is only safe
to change the number of tics representing a millisecond if no
Time objects exist or it is guaranteed that all Time objects are
reinitialized before usage. Only the network can do this.
Therefore the functions
  set_tics_per_ms
and
  set_tics_per_step_default
are only accessible by specific members of the Network
 (reset, set_status)
