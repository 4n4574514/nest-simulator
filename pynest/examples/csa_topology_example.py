Using CSA with Topology layers
------------------------------

This example shows a brute-force way of specifying connections
between NEST Topology layers using Connection Set Algebra.

We define a factory that returns a CSA-style geometry function for
the given layer. The function returned will return for each CSA-index
the position in space of the given neuron as a 2- or 3-element list.

This function stores a copy of the neuron positions internally,
entailing memory overhead.
