# Developing NEST with Eclipse

These instructions are based on Eclipse *Mars* (4.5). They are based
on earlier instructions by Thomas Heiberg.

## Installing Eclipse

### Prerequisites

You have to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) v. 1.7.0 (Java 7) or later
installed. Just a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not enough.

You can download the JDK from
[Oracle's JDK8 Download Page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

### Eclipse

From http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/, download either the "Eclipse
IDE for C/C++ Developers" or the "Eclipse Installer" and use it to
install the C/C++ IDE (until the official release of Eclipse Mars on
24 June 2015, this option is available under "Developer Builds").

Under OSX, always download the 64-bit version. Under Windows or Linux,
download the version that fits your operating system.

### Workspace

In this document, I assume that you collect all your Eclipse projects
in a single workspace, located at `$HOME/eclipse/workspace`. This will
keep most Eclipse-generated files out of your code directories,
reducing clutter there. But you can place your workspace
anywhere.

### PyDev

Once you have installed and started Eclipse, go to `Help > Eclipse
Marketplace` and install the `PyDev` extension.

Once `PyDev` is installed, open the Eclipse preferences, go to `PyDev
> Interpreters > Python Interpreter` and configure your
interpreter. You can try `Advance Auto-Config`, but this will often
not detect the correct Python interpreter. In that case, choose `New
...` and browse to the executable of your Python interpreter, e.g.,
`$HOME/anaconda/bin/python2.7`.

You need to repeat this step for each new workspace you enter.

## Setting up NEST with Eclipse

### Preparations

You should bootstrap and configure NEST as usual. This document
assumes the following directory layout:

    $NEST_ROOT/src          # source code
    $NEST_ROOT/bld          # build directory
    $NEST_ROOT/bld/ins   # install directory

You should build and install NEST manually once:

    cd $NEST_ROOT/bld
    $NEST_ROOT/src/configure --prefix=$NEST_ROOT/bld/ins
	make -j4
	make install
	make installcheck

### Project setup

1. `File > New > Makefile project with existing code`
1. Choose an arbitrary project name
1. Browse to the `$NEST_ROOT/src` directory
1. Keep `C` and `C++` checked
1. Choose `GNU Autotools Toolchain` for indexer settings.
1. Click `Finish`

The indexer will scan the code, this may take a while.

To make Eclipse aware of configuration-dependent settings, especially
include guards such as `HAVE_GSL`, we need to add header files from
the build directory. To this end, select the project in the project
browser and choose`Properties` from the context menu. Then

1. go to `C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols`
1. choose "Includes" tab and there `GNU C`
1. click 'Add'
1. check off for "Add to all configurations" and "Add to all
languages"
1. click "File system ..." and select the `$NEST_ROOT/bld/libnestutil`
directory
1. add the `$NEST_ROOT/bld/nest` directory in the same way
1. rebuild the index when Eclipse suggest it or by choosing `Index >
   Rebuild` from the context menu on the project.

Finally, we need to tell Eclipse about the build path.

1. Choose the project in the project browser, then `Properties` from the context
menu.
1. Go to `C/C++ Build` and in the "Build location" section click
`File system ...`, then choose `$NEST_ROOT/bld`.
1. If you want to build in parallel, remove the check for "Use default
   build command` and enter `make -j4` as build command (replace 4
   with a suitable number for your computer).

And we need to amend the search path for tools Eclipse uses. In the
project properties browser,

1. go to `C/C++ Build > Enviroment`
1. click `Select ...` and choose `PATH`
1. select `PATH` in the variables list and click `Edit ...`
1. prepend to the path
    1. `/usr/local/bin:` if you use Homebrew
    1. `/opt/local/bin:` if you use MacPorts

You can now build the project by choosing `Build project` from the
context menu.

To install or run the testsuite, you should add additional make
targets:

1. Go to the Context Menu of the project
1. Choose `Make Targets > Create ...` and add a target,
e.g. `install` by entering this as the target name.
1. Remove the check for "Run all project builders".
1. You should create targets `all`, `install`, `install-exec` and
`installcheck`.
1. You can run the targets by choosing `Make Targets > Build ...`from
the Context Menu.

### Running NEST

To run NEST within Eclipse,

1. go to the project properties browser
1. select `Run/Debug Settings`
1. select `NEST Build (GNU)` and click `Edit ...`
1. under `C/C++ Application` click `Browse ...` and select
`$NEST_ROOT/bld/ins/bin/nest`

You can now run NEST by clicking the "Play" button.

**DO NOT QUIT NEST WITH CTRL-D, or your computer WILL HANG HORRIBLY!**
