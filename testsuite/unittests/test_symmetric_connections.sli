Name: testsuite::test_symmetric_connections - Tests that the functionality to create
symmetric connections works properly.

Synopsis: (test_symmetric_connections) run -> NEST exits if test fails

Description: 
This test ensures that the functionality to create symmetric connections
works properly.

In more detail the test ensures that
- the symmetric flag works properly with one-to-one connection rule
- the usage of the symmetric flag with any other connections throws
  an NotImplemented exception
