    Name: testsuite::test_iaf_psc_exp_ps_lossless - sli script for overall test of iaf_psc_exp model

    Synopsis: (test_iaf_psc_exp_ps_lossless) run -> compares response to current step with reference data 

    Description:
    test_iaf_psc_exp_ps_lossless.sli is an overall test of the iaf_psc_exp_ps_lossless model connected
    to some useful devices.

    A DC current is injected into the neuron using a current generator 
    device. The membrane potential as well as the spiking activity are 
    recorded by corresponding devices.

    It can be observed how the current charges the membrane, a spike
    is emitted, the neuron becomes absolute refractory, and finally
    starts to recover.

    The timing of the various events on the simulation grid is of 
    particular interest and crucial for the consistency of the 
    simulation scheme.

    Although 0.1 cannot be represented in the IEEE double data type, it
    is safe to simulate with a resolution (computation step size) of 0.1
    ms because by default nest is built with a timebase enabling exact
    representation of 0.1 ms.

    The expected output is documented and briefly commented at the end of 
    the script. The textual output of the voltmeter documented in this file
    can be regenerated by setting adding /to_screen true to the SetStatus
    call of vm below.

    Other test programs discuss the various aspects of this script in detail,
    see the SeeAlso key below.

                     %      The simulation was run for 8.0 ms. However, in the step
                     %      7.9 ms -> 8.0 ms the voltmeter necessarily receives the
                     %      voltages that occurred at time 7.9 ms (delay h). This
                     %      results in different end times of the recorded voltage

                     %      problem. One workaround is to end the simulation script
                     %      with "h Simulate", thereby making the script resolution
                     %      dependent.
