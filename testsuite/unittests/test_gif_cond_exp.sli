Name: testsuite::test_gif_cond_exp - sli script for test of gif_cond_exp with external DC current and spike generators

Synopsis: (test_gif_cond_exp) run


Description:

 This testscript checks the correctness of gif_psc_exp neuron model. It injects external DC current and also three spikes to two neurons and measures their spike times. The spike times should match the expected values.
